### 130. Surrounded Regions

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:

```js
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:

```js
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

Explanation:

`Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border`, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. `Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

### Analyze

```js
/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
 */
var solve = function(board) {
  const used = []
  for (let m = 0; m < board.length; m++) {
    for (let n = 0; n < board[m].length; n++) {
      if (used.indexOf(`${m},${n}`) === -1) {
        recursive(board, m, n, used)
      }
    }
  }
  return board
};

var direction = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]] // 下、右、上、左

var isValid = (border, m, n, used) => {
  if (!border[m] || !border[m][n]) return false
  const notUsed = used.indexOf(`${m},${n}`) === -1
  // const notBorder =
  return notUsed && border[m][n] === 'O' &&
}

var recursive = function(used) {

}
```
